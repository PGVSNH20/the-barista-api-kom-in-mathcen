# Project 1 - Procedures
In this first project should you be working with what have been discussed regarding OOP in the theory for this lecture.

On the end of the project are your group going to present (a mini-presentation) the key points of you solution (walk through the code). And the rest of the class will give a points for the solution.

Work with mob programming, one driver, 10 min per driver, driver is the person how uses the keyboard and shares his/her screen, the others are helping the driver by trying to be one step head of the driver (coming with suggestions on what to write).

Everybody in the group is driver on turn. The last thing the drives does before leaving the keyboard to the next driver is to perform a commit and push of the code to GitHub.

## Team

The team consist of 3 to 4 persons, with the following roles:

- **Driver**, the one sitting in front of the computer, and the only one using the keyboard and mouse, shares his/her screen
- **Spy**, when signal is given should this person spy on another team
- **Timekeeper**, has a "stopwatch" and makes sure the team switch places as close to 10 min as possible and that the spy only spies the allowed time
- **Co-driver** (only for teams of four), everybody is in theory co-drivers and helps the driver. The term is taken from Rally where the co-driver keeps track on the track and the driver is responsible of steering the car.

The team rotate roles every 10 minutes, following this pattern:

* Spy becomes Driver
* Timekeeper becomes Spy
* Driver becomes Timekeeper, in case of four team members will the Driver become co-driver, and the co-driver become Timekeeper.

## Spying

When the signal (a chat message in discord: "SPY!!! (Spy talk with driver for 45 sec only)") is given should all spys go to the channel of another team to learn about their solution. Only the driver is allowed to talk with the spy and answer all the spy's questions. The total spy session from signal is given is **only** 45 seconds! And it's the assignment of the timekeeper to cut of the spy, and tell him/her to leave with what ever information he/she got.

A hint is to plan the spying: which team are we spying at? what are we looking for?

The result of the spying should be shown as comment in the code like this:

```C#
// Spy: <a short desciption of findings>
```

## Mini-presentation of the project

At the end of the project, will each group do a mini presentation. Before the start of the presentations should you in the team decide on who is going to do the talking (send it in a discord chat message).

Be precise you only have **5 min**.
